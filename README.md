# Cryptor
An bot built with Elixir for buy and sell crypto currencies.

# Running in dev
First ensure you have [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.15.4.
You can use nvm to manage node version.

Then, at the root project directory, run `asdf install` so that Elixir and Erlang with the right version will be installed.

Now, just run `mix setup` and finally, you can run `mix phx.server`

If you want to navigate between the app pages, an account is required.
